To make Char Kway Teow, you’ll need 400 g flat rice noodles (kway teow), 200 g raw prawns (peeled, deveined), 100–150 g Chinese sausage (lap cheong) sliced, 2–3 eggs, 150 g bean sprouts, a handful of Chinese chives (cut into 2-inch lengths), 3 garlic cloves (minced), 2 tbsp light soy sauce, 1 tbsp dark soy sauce, 1 tbsp oyster sauce, 1 tsp sugar, 1 tbsp sambal or chilli paste (adjust to taste), 2 tbsp oil or rendered pork lard, and salt/pepper to taste. Heat a large wok until very hot, add the oil/lard and quickly stir-fry the garlic until fragrant, then add the sliced sausage and prawns and toss for 1–2 minutes; push everything to the side, crack in the eggs and scramble briefly, then add the noodles and sauces, tossing fast to coat and allowing some noodles to get a little char. Add bean sprouts and chives, season with sugar, salt and pepper, stir-fry another 1–2 minutes until everything is heated through but still crisp, and finish with extra dark soy for color if desired; serve immediately with lime or sliced chilies on the side.
