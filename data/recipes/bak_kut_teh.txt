To make Bak Kut Teh, you'll need 1 kg pork ribs, 10-12 cloves garlic (unpeeled), 1 packet of Bak Kut Teh herbs, 2 liters water, 2 tbsp dark soy sauce, 1 tbsp light soy sauce, 1 tsp white peppercorns, and salt to taste. First, blanch the pork ribs in boiling water for a few minutes to remove impurities, then rinse and set aside. In a large pot, combine the blanched pork ribs, unpeeled garlic cloves, Bak Kut Teh herb packet, and white peppercorns. Pour in 2 liters of water and bring to a boil. Once boiling, reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for at least 1.5 to 2 hours, or until the pork is tender. During the last 15-20 minutes of cooking, add the dark soy sauce, light soy sauce, and salt to taste. Stir well to combine. Serve hot with steamed rice and a side of chopped chilies in soy sauce.
