For classic Hainanese chicken rice (serves 3–4): use 1 whole chicken (about 1.5 kg), 2 cups jasmine rice, 6–8 garlic cloves (split), a 5 cm piece ginger (divided), 4 scallions, 2–3 tbsp sesame oil, 2–3 tbsp light soy sauce, salt, cucumber slices and cilantro to serve. Rub the chicken inside and out with salt, stuff the cavity with a few smashed garlic cloves, a knob of sliced ginger and 1 scallion, then gently poach in barely‑simmering water for 30–35 minutes until cooked; remove and plunge into ice water briefly (optional) to tighten the skin, then reserve and strain the poaching liquid as your stock. For the rice, sauté minced garlic and minced ginger in 2 tbsp chicken fat or oil until fragrant, stir in the rinsed rice to coat, then cook with about 2½ cups of the strained chicken stock (adjust liquid for your rice cooker/pot) until fluffy. Make the sauces: ginger‑scallion oil (finely grate ginger + chopped scallion, pour very hot oil over and season with salt), chili sauce (blend red chilies, garlic, ginger, a little sugar, lime juice and some chicken stock), and a simple soy dip (light soy + sesame oil). Carve the chicken, brush with a little sesame oil and light soy, serve with fragrant rice, sliced cucumber, sauces and bowls of the clear chicken soup.
