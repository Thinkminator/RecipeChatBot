To make Katong Laksa, you'll need 400g thick rice vermicelli (laksa noodles) cut into short lengths, 300-350g prawns (peeled, shells reserved), 150-200g fish cake or sliced fish balls, 1.2-1.5L prawn or chicken stock, 400ml coconut milk, 3-4 tbsp laksa paste, 1 tbsp oil, 1 tsp sugar, fish sauce or salt to taste, and a handful of shredded laksa leaves (Vietnamese coriander), with sambal chilli and lime wedges for serving. First, make a quick prawn stock by saut√©ing the reserved prawn shells in a little oil, then adding water and simmering for 15-20 minutes before straining. In a separate pot, heat 1 tbsp oil and fry the laksa paste until fragrant for 2-3 minutes, then add the strained prawn stock and bring to a gentle simmer. Stir in the coconut milk, sugar, and a splash of fish sauce, simmering on low for 5-8 minutes without boiling hard. Add the prawns, fish cake, and any optional cockles, cooking until the prawns turn pink (2-3 minutes), then adjust seasoning. Briefly warm the cut laksa noodles in hot water or in the simmering broth, then place them into bowls and ladle over the rich broth with the cooked ingredients. Finish with shredded laksa leaves, a dollop of sambal, a squeeze of lime, and optional fried shallots, serving immediately.
