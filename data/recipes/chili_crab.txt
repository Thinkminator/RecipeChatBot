For Singapore-style chilli crab (serves 3–4): use 1.5–2 kg live mud/crab (cleaned and cut into pieces), 3 tbsp oil, 4 shallots (finely sliced), 4 garlic cloves (minced), 2 red chilies (sliced) or 2–3 tbsp sambal oelek, 2 tbsp tomato ketchup, 3 tbsp sweet chili sauce, 1–2 tbsp light soy sauce, 1 tbsp rice vinegar or Chinese black vinegar, 1 tsp sugar, 250 ml chicken or seafood stock, 1–2 tbsp cornstarch mixed with 2–3 tbsp water (slurry), 1 large egg (lightly beaten), 1 tbsp butter, chopped cilantro and sliced spring onions to finish, and steamed or fried mantou to serve. Heat the oil in a large wok, stir-fry shallots, garlic and chilies until fragrant, add the crab pieces and toss to coat; add ketchup, sweet chili sauce, sambal, soy sauce, vinegar, sugar and the stock, bring to a simmer, cover and cook 8–10 minutes until the crab is cooked through. Remove the lid, stir in the cornstarch slurry to thicken the sauce, adjust seasoning, then slowly drizzle in the beaten egg while stirring for a silky texture, finish with butter and a splash of sesame oil if liked, garnish with cilantro and spring onion, and serve immediately with mantou and plenty of napkins.
